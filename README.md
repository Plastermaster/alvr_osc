# alvr_osc
OSC client for ALVR, primarily made to send battery status of the Quest 2 to VRChat.

Requires [websocket-client](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client) and [python-osc](https://github.com/attwad/python-osc)

todo: FIX EVERYTHING! Due to not knowing about which parameters get synced and which ones don't there is a massive problem with the current version, mainly it being only available locally. I will fix this eventually once I get some time again, currently I am unable to work on this.
